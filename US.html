   <h2>United States</h2>
   <p>The United States has been issuing coins since 1793 with the large cent. Since then<br>
   US coins have become the largest market for coin collectors in the world, with many of the<br>
   most expensive coins ever sold being from the US (1913 Libery Head Nickel, 1804 Dollar, etc.)<br>
   This page will cover some key dates for some American coins. </p>

   <h3><img src="lincoln.webp" alt="wheatpenny" width="100" height="80"> Lincoln Wheat Penny</h3>
   <p>The Lincoln cent with wheat ears is perhaps the most famous coin series ever issued by the United<br>
    States, is not the world.  While Abraham Lincoln is still on the obverse of the penny, the wheat ear<br>
    reverse was only used until 1958, after which is was replaced with the Lincoln Memorial and later in<br>
    2010, a shield. Below are some valuable dates for the wheat series.</p>

<h3> Wheat Penny varieties</h3>
<p>Sometimes, coins will have varieties, that is, there may be a distinguishing characteristic<br>
    between two coins of the same mint, year, and denomination that make it more or less valuable.<br>
    A famous example of this is the inclusion of the initials "VDB" on the bottom of the reverse of<br>
    the 1909 Wheat cent. At the time is was controversial as people believed it detracted from Lincoln's<br>
    so it was removed in the middle of 1909, creating a rare variety for the coins that did have the initials,<br>
    Below is a comparison of a reverse with and without the initials.
